# evcharginDLT
A novel DLT-based python package, built with RUST, for P2P energy trading modeling/simulation and analysis

Functionalities to be developed:
1. Simulation a P2P energy trading pricing mechanisms enabled by DLT, particularly focusing on EV offering charing services to mircomobility scenarios
2. Simulating the private charging pole short-term lending behaviours for residents or small businesses that own charging facilities, and their impact on urban traffic network, this will include multiple
3. Benchmarking the EV's decentralised energy storage capacities, and their impact on urban resilience, including a scenario where EV supports daily appliance usages when the power grid is down due to disastrous events.(also include the projections as the batter technology evolves)

Scenarios aimed to portray:
